I’m a technology leader with over 10 years experience. I've had the privilege of working on cutting edge technologies while developing high-performing teams in software development, DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering and Platform Engineering.

I currently lead three teams who are responsible for a large multi-tenant Kubernetes platform that houses over 4,000 applications with rigorous standards for uptime, security, and compliance. We’ve been leading with Platform Engineering ideals since before it was an industry buzzword; building useful abstractions to simplify platform operations with a product mindset. I’ve been able to provide value to this team by leading product vision, building two additional teams to support growing demand for the platform, developing talent through performance management, and navigating several difficult migrations.

My experience at Under Armour prepared me for leadership roles by giving me the opportunity to manage multi-million dollar vendor contracts, build teams, and drive organization-wide change. Shortly after joining Under Armour, I led the infrastructure team through a divestiture from MyFitnessPal. I was tasked with quickly rebuilding the team following the divestiture, defining a technical roadmap with clear OKRs, and implementing best-practice standards for cost-mitigation and security.

Prior to my experience as an engineering leader I was an individual contributor in DevOps and SRE where I gained expertise in networking, cloud infrastructure, software development (Python & Golang), and Kubernetes.
