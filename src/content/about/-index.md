I'm **Jake Walden** and I’m a technology leader with over 10 years experience. I've had the privilege of working on cutting edge technologies while developing high-performing teams in software development, DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering and Platform Engineering.

I'm currently leading several teams who are responsible for a large multi-tenant Kubernetes platform that hosts over 4,000 applications with rigorous standards for uptime, security, and compliance. We’ve been leading with Platform Engineering ideals since before it was an industry buzzword; building useful abstractions to simplify platform operations with a product mindset. I’ve been able to provide value to this team by leading product vision, building two additional teams to support growing demand for the platform, developing talent through performance management, and navigating several difficult migrations.
